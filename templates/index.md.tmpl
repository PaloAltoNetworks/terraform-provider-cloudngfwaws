# Provider cloudngfwaws

The cloudngfwaws provider provides resources to manage your Palo Alto Networks Cloud Next-Gen Firewalls for AWS.

Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW combines best-in-class network security with cloud ease of use and delivers the leading ML-powered NGFW as a cloud-native service on AWS.

Refer to [the changelog](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-provider-cloudngfwaws/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see what's new.


## Enable API Access

Before this provider can be used, you must first enable API access.  The steps to do this can be found [here](https://pan.dev/cloudngfw/aws/api/).


## Authentication Workflow

This provider first authenticates against AWS, performing STS assume role. After that is successful, it then retrieves the JWTs for firewall and rulestack administration.

The AWS access key and secret key can be statically specified in the `provider` block or they will be picked up from the shared credentials file.


## AWS Config

The initial portion of the authentication workflow uses the AWS Go SDK, and as such control over the AWS portion of the authentication can be controlled using AWS environment variables (e.g. - `AWS_PROFILE` to specific a specific profile if multiple are present in your shared credentials file).  Please refer to the AWS documentation for more control on the AWS authentication.


## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

Example JSON config file:

{{codefile "shell" "examples/provider/json_config_file.sh"}}


## Provider Parameter Priority

There are multiple ways to specify the provider's parameters.  If overlapping values are configured for the provider, then this is the resolution order:

1. Statically configured in the `provider` block
2. Environment variable (where applicable)
3. Taken from the JSON config file

## ezrulestack Module

ezrulestack module allows for faster and simpler workflow to create rulestacks, by defining the dependencies between security objects, rules, rulestack and commit resources implicitly. User can specify the resources and ezrulestack module will resolve the dependencies and create the resources in the necessary order. Follow the example [here](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-provider-cloudngfwaws/tree/main/examples/modules/ezrulestack) for creating a rulestack using ezrulestack module. Documentation for ezrulestack module can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/cloudngfwaws/latest/docs/guides/ezrulestack)
